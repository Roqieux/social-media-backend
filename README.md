## Description

A backend API to support a social media. Includes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, I have also used a native JavaScript `Date` object and Web API to format timestamps.

Be sure to checkout the walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the API using Insomnia after creating the API.
